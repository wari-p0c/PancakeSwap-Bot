- 🌏 Sell tokens with your custom increase in price, like 50%, 100%, 200%.
- 💸 Contains Stop loss (Set SL% to 0 for no Stop loss, Trailing Stop loss at 20% means it will set up a Stop loss after at 20% below the current price once it hits your take profit level, set at 100% to disable. Set TP% (Take profit %) to 120% for 20% gain, 100% is the base so 0x, 200% is 1x on your investment
